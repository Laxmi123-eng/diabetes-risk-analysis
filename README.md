# Diabetes Risk Analysis

This project analyzes diabetes risk using the Diabetes dataset.

## Contents
- **Python (Jupyter Notebook)**: Logistic regression model with EDA, evaluation metrics, ROC curve, and feature importance.
- **Power BI Dashboard**: Interactive dashboard visualizing diabetes prevalence by Age, BMI, Pregnancies, and Diabetes Pedigree Function.

## Key Insights
- Higher **Glucose** levels strongly increase the likelihood of diabetes.
- Higher **BMI (Body Mass Index)** is positively associated with diabetes risk.
- **Age** is an important factor, with prevalence increasing in older groups.
- **Pregnancies** show a positive correlation: women with more pregnancies have higher risk, consistent with gestational diabetes.
- **Diabetes Pedigree Function** also contributes positively. This is a derived indicator reflecting hereditary influence (not a direct family history field).
- **Blood Pressure, Skin Thickness, and Insulin** have weaker or inconsistent effects in this dataset.
